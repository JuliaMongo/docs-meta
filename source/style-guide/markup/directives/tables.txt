.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Directive
     - Description

   * - :rst:`list-table </directives.html#list-table>`
     - Table generated from a list of lists

Use Case
--------

Use tables whenever you find you have written a list with one or more
dashes, colons, or semicolons to separate content on each line.

Example
-------

The ``list-table`` directive creates a table from data in a two-level
bulleted list. The first level of bullet points specifies rows, and
the second level of bullet points specifies columns. Each row must
contain the same number of columns.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. list-table:: Hobbits
         :widths: 60 10 30
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Name
           - Height
           - Nickname
         * - Peregrin Took
